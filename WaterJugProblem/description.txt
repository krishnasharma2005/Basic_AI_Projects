Water Jug Problem Solver using Breadth-First Search (BFS)
This project solves the classic Water Jug Problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. The objective is to find the shortest sequence of steps to measure an exact amount of water using two jugs of given capacities.

Problem Statement:
Given two jugs of capacities jug1 and jug2, the goal is to measure exactly target liters of water, using a minimal sequence of operations.

Key Features:
Implements BFS to explore all possible valid states (combinations of water in the two jugs).
Tracks the shortest path from the initial state (0, 0) to a state where one of the jugs holds exactly the target amount.
Supports the standard operations:
  Fill either jug.
  Empty either jug.
  Pour water from one jug to another.

Output:
Prints a step-by-step path of jug states leading to the target volume.
If no solution exists, returns an appropriate message.

Applications:
Demonstrates the use of state space search algorithms in AI.
Useful in algorithmic problem-solving, puzzles, and teaching graph traversal techniques.
Can be extended to solve other constraint-based problems or model resource transfers.
