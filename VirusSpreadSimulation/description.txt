Virus Spread Simulation in a Hospital Grid
This project models the spread of a virus in a hospital using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach on a 2D grid. It calculates the minimum time required to infect all reachable healthy individuals in the hospital and reports whether a complete infection is possible.

Key Features:
-Accepts user-defined grid size and infection status.
-Treats 1 as infected individuals and 0 as healthy individuals.
-Simulates infection spread in four directions (up, down, left, right).
-Calculates the total time required to infect all healthy people.
-Handles edge cases like all already infected or unreachable individuals.
-Displays the final state of the hospital grid after the simulation.

How It Works:
-Initializes a BFS queue with all initially infected cells and tracks the time taken to infect neighboring cells.
-In each step, adjacent healthy cells are infected and added to the queue with an incremented time.
-Continues the process until no further infections are possible.
  
Output:
-Shows the final state of the grid using NumPy for easy visualization.
-Prints the minimum time steps required for a full infection.
-If not all individuals can be infected, it returns -1.

Applications:
-Demonstrates BFS in grid-based simulations.
-Useful for studying epidemic modeling and contagion dynamics.
-Can be extended to model quarantines, immunity, or probabilistic infections.
