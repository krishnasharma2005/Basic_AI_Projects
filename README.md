This repository contains a collection of classic AI and algorithmic problem-solving exercises implemented in Python. These projects demonstrate foundational concepts such as **state space search**, **heuristic-based planning**, and **grid simulations** using simple and intuitive examples.

## Projects Included

### 1. Knightâ€™s Shortest Path on a Chessboard
- Uses **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** to find the shortest path a knight can take from a start to a target position on an N x N chessboard.
- Displays the number of moves and the complete path taken.

### 2. A* Pathfinding on a Grid
- Implements the **A\* search algorithm** with **Manhattan distance** as the heuristic.
- Finds the shortest path from a start point to a goal on a grid with user-defined obstacles.
- Visualizes the final path and obstacle layout in the terminal.

### 3. Virus Spread Simulation
- Simulates the spread of infection in a hospital grid using **BFS**.
- Computes the minimum time required to infect all reachable individuals.
- Prints the final infected grid using **NumPy** for better visualization.

### 4. Water Jug Problem Solver
- Solves the classic **Water Jug Problem** using **BFS**.
- Determines the minimum sequence of steps to measure an exact amount of water using two jugs.
- Provides a trace of all jug states from start to solution.
